Here’s a compact, no-nonsense short list that reliably covers the undergraduate ODE landscape—from classical methods to qualitative/dynamical-systems.

| Textbook (edition varies)                                                      | Publisher   | Theory (10) | Applied (10) | Readability (10) |

**Why these five (very briefly):**

* **Boyce–DiPrima** — The standard engineering-friendly spine: methods + BVPs, Laplace, Fourier, and numerical introductions; huge problem sets.
* **Blanchard–Devaney–Hall** — Modern qualitative viewpoint (phase plane, stability, bifurcations) integrated with linear algebra and modeling; great for intuition.
* **Edwards–Penney** — Method-forward and application-heavy with many modeling examples; smooth on-ramp for computing projects.
* **Simmons** — Deeper proofs with superb exposition and historical context; excellent bridge to more theoretical study.
* **Tenenbaum–Pollard** — Classical, rigorous methods and an enormous problem bank; slightly old-school style but unbeatable drill.

**Notable alternates (by the publishers you flagged):**

* **Springer (SUMS/UTM):** Braun, *Differential Equations and Their Applications* (applications-first); Chicone, *Ordinary Differential Equations with Applications* (more theoretical, edging toward advanced UG).
* **Cambridge/Oxford/MIT-adjacent:** Strang, *Differential Equations and Linear Algebra* (very readable, linear-algebra centric; great for modeling/computation); Hirsch–Smale–Devaney, *Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, & an Introduction to Chaos* (Academic Press; advanced undergrad dynamical-systems flavor).
