Here’s a concise, high-signal set that spans rigorous calculus and first real analysis.

**How to use this set**

* Want rigorous calculus with a proof mindset? Start with **Spivak** → then **Abbott**.
* Prefer a single coherent path from calculus into linear algebra and analysis? Do **Apostol Vol. 1**.
* Need a terse reference and stretch goals? Add **Rudin** (selected chapters).
* For multivariable with applications and modern tools, use **Hubbard & Hubbard**.
