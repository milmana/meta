Here’s a concise, high-signal short list. Ratings are on 10.

| Sheldon Axler, *Linear Algebra Done Right*                                           | Springer (UTM)                   | Abstract vector-space first, eigenstuff early, minimal matrices | **10** |   **3** |       **8** |
| Gilbert Strang, *Introduction to Linear Algebra*                                     | Wellesley–Cambridge (MIT course) | Concepts + computation + modeling; many applications            |  **6** |   **9** |       **9** |
| David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, Judi J. McDonald, *Linear Algebra and Its Applications* | Pearson                          | Computation with gradual proof; engineering/business uses       |  **6** |   **8** |       **9** |
| Elizabeth S. Meckes & Mark W. Meckes, *Linear Algebra*                               | Cambridge Univ. Press            | Clean proofs, geometry, SVD/QR presented conceptually           |  **8** |   **6** |       **8** |
| Volker Mehrmann & Volker Liesen, *Linear Algebra*                                    | Springer                         | Rigorous, modern viewpoint; links to numerical themes           |  **9** |   **6** |       **7** |

Notes, to help you choose:

* If you want a proof-centric foundation fast: **Axler** → excellent for theory, light on algorithms.
* If you want a broad, application-friendly first pass: **Strang** or **Lay** → both are friendly; Strang leans conceptual, Lay leans systematic exercises.
* If you want a balanced, modern “honors” text: **Meckes & Meckes** → proofs with good geometric intuition.
* If you want rigorous theory with a bridge to numerics: **Liesen & Mehrmann** → a bit terser, strong structure.

If you want alternates in a specific direction (e.g., more applied like Anton–Rorres; more abstract like Hoffman–Kunze), say the word and I’ll slot them with the same rubric.
