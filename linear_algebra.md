Here are “solid” linear algebra picks, organized by flavor—plus a minimal stack if you want just one path.

# Core proof-first (great foundations)

* **Axler — *Linear Algebra Done Right***: Clean, eigen-/invariant-space focus; postpones determinants; excellent exercises.
* **Treil — *Linear Algebra Done Wrong*** (free): Inner-product spaces and norms early; bridges naturally to analysis/functional analysis.
* **Halmos — *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces***: Coordinate-free, terse, elegant; superb for spectral theorem maturity.

# More algebraic/structural

* **Hoffman & Kunze — *Linear Algebra***: Primary decomposition, Jordan form, canonical structures; a classic for deep structure.

# Operator/analysis flavor (good for calculus links)

* **Lax — *Linear Algebra and Its Applications***: Operators, norms, conditioning; explicit ties to ODEs/PDEs and approximation.
* **Shilov — *Linear Algebra***: Rigorous, complex inner-product spaces and canonical forms with an analytic bent.

# Matrix & numerical complements

* **Trefethen & Bau — *Numerical Linear Algebra***: Algorithms, QR/SVD, conditioning—pairs perfectly with any theory text.
* **Horn & Johnson — *Matrix Analysis***: Inequalities, spectra, unitarily invariant norms; the go-to advanced reference.

# Geometric/intuition

* **Strang — *Introduction to Linear Algebra***: Intuitive, application-rich; less proof-heavy but superb for insight.

# If you want a single streamlined route

* **Theory first**: Axler (or Treil) → selected chapters of Lax → Trefethen & Bau.
* **Operator/spectral emphasis** (your lane): Halmos → Lax → Horn & Johnson (as needed).

# Problem books (to cement skill)

* **Halmos — *Linear Algebra Problem Book***
* **Prasolov — *Problems in Linear Algebra*** (challenging, high-yield)

Given your interests in spectral/operator theory: start with **Halmos**, run computations alongside **Trefethen & Bau**, and keep **Horn & Johnson** handy for depth.
